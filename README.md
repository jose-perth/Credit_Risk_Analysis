# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

This project is the weekly challenge for week 17 of the Data Science Bootcamp. It allows us to put into practice and showcase the skills learned in Module 17 of the bootcamp.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.

This would allow us to evaluate the performance fo these models and make recommendations on their suitability to predict credit risk.

## Results

The following files are part of the analysis:

- [credit_risk_resampling.ipynb](credit_risk_resampling.ipynb) : Jupyter Notebook used in deliverables 1 and 2.
- [credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb](credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb) : Jupyter Notebook used in deliverable 3.
